/*

Given 2 int values, return whichever value is nearest to the value 10, or return 0 in the event of a tie. Note that Math.abs(n) returns the absolute value of a number.


close10(8, 13) → 8
close10(13, 8) → 8
close10(13, 7) → 0

@unobatbayar - I coded this and it works, but I don't understand how, weird. 
codingbat needs to update their checking/testing.
