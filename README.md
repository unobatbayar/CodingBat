#### Master the Basics First

Before diving into complex problems, ensure you have a solid understanding of the basic building blocks of problem-solving, such as:

 - **Data Structures**: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash maps, heaps, tries, etc.
 - **Algorithms**: Sorting algorithms, searching algorithms (binary search, DFS, BFS), dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, backtracking, etc.
 - **Time and Space Complexity**: Learn Big-O notation and practice analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms.
